                                The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph,
                                page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying
                                out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on
                                design, not content.

                                The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their
                                dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their
                                software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our
